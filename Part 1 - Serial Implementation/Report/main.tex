\section{Introduction - The Problem} \label{intro}
Fractals are figures in which a pattern occurs recursively in infinitely smaller scales. A very popular fractal is the Mandelbrot Set, which shows when a given complex number will diverge when input into the formula $f(z) = z^2 + c$. This work focuses on creating a tree fractal. The simple idea is that we start with a vertical line, then from this first line, 2 more straight lines are drawn from the upper vertex of the first line at some angle at equal distance from each other. These will be called the children lines, while the original line will be called the parent line. Then from these 2 children lines, another 2 are drawn from each line, for which the first line is the grandparent, and so on. The angles at which the new lines are drawn may vary, however in this work, an equal angle between the 2 lines is considered, where the first child line is drawn at an angle $angle_{parent} + \theta$ while the second child line is at $angle_{parent} - \theta$. Note that this is a recursive definition. The first line, as stated, is a vertical line, and this first angle will be considered as the 0 angle, so that the children will have angles at $0\pm \theta$. The length of the children are different from that to the parent, but equal to each other. A constant real number $m$ is set at the start, and the children are of length $length_{parent} * m$ (another recursive definition). An example of these concepts is in figure \ref{general explanation}, with an explanation of the terms in the next section. This report will be discussing the serial implementation of this problem while discussing the necessary preparation for the parallel implementation as well as presenting some obtained results accompanied by graphs using Matplotlib \cite{matplotlib}. Interesting to note is that other variants of this problem exists, such as parents having more than three children, or the width of the branches also changing each generation. However, this implementation will cover a binary tree fractal with constant branch width (to be distinguished from length). In the next section, the process as well as the variables of this implementation are discussed. During the research section of this project, I was not able to find any parallel implementation of this particular fractal, hence none will be discussed. \cite{natureofcode} does however provide a detailed explanation of the problem and also gives a recursive pseudo code serial implementation.

\section{Conclusion}
This concludes this report for the serial implementation of creating tree fractals. A description of how this solution can be implemented serially was discussed. A general idea on how this solution may be parallellized is presented and finally results were shown using graphs to display how long the pipeline of the problem takes. A study on the time complexity of the problem was also made for completion.
